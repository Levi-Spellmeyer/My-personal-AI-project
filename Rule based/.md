This example could be taken further by aquiring an api to an existing LLM. This LLM could then be based the list of candidates
and the origional string and asked to choose the best candidate as its response. This example does not incorporate the ML aspects that I would
like to implement but did do a good job of looking into how entropy could be used to make predicitons related to what strings are hashed with.

It is important to note that the above rule based classifier example does not "learn" as other LLM or AI agents do. The above example improves through manual updates to the rules that govern its decisions. This example does not update itself or permanently learn new things without manual intervention.
